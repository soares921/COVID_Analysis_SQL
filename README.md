# Analysis and Visualization of Coronavirus (COVID-19)

This project demonstrates SQL and Tableau skills used to analyze COVID-19 data from January 2020 to the present (June 2023). The data analyzed in this project compares
the COVID-19 deaths per country to the COVID-19 vaccination rate per country. The Tableau Dashboard presents the global numbers of the total cases, total deaths, and 
death percentage, the death count per continent, the percent of the population infected per country, and the average percent of the population infected of five major countries
from June 2022 to June 2023 and their potential forecast for the next few months.
